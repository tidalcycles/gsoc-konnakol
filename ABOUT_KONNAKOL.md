## Brief Introduction to Konnakol

Konnakol, in South Indian Carnatic music, is the art of performing percussion syllables vocally. It is the recitation os _Solkattu_ - the vocal syllables related to the sounds of the _Mridangam_, a major percussion instrument in Carnatic Music. Recognized as an art form of principal study, Konnakol is also a medium used by Carnatic musicians to convery rhythmic ideas to each other.

## The Suladi Sapta Thala System

Thala, is the term used in Carnatic music to denote a complicated equivalent of a rhythmic cycle. A thala is usually represented with three hand gestures, namely the Laghu, the Dhruta, and the Anudhruta. A laghu is a hand clap along with finger counts, a dhruta is two claps, the second one with the hand overturned. The anudhruta is merely a clap. 

There are seven fundamental thalas, which are as follows:
1. Dhruva Thala - Laghu, Dhruta, Laghu, Laghu
2. Matya Thala - Laghu, Dhruta, Laghu
3. Rupaka Thala - Dhruta, Laghu
4. Jhampe Thala - Laghu, Anudhruta, Dhruta
5. Thriputa Thala - Laghu, Dhruta, Dhruta
6. Atta Thala - Laghu, Laghu, Dhruta, Dhruta
7. Eka Thala - Laghu

Along with the 7 thalas, there are 5 _Jatis_, where each Jati will tell us the length of the Laghu in the thala. 
The five Jatis are as follows:
1. Tisra - 3
2. Chaturasra - 4
3. Khanda - 5
4. Misra - 7
5. Sankirna - 9

Hence, the Chaturasra Jati Thriputa thala gives us a Laghu of length 4, followed by two Dhrutas. This is also known as the Adi Thala, one of the most commonly known thalas. Therefore, these 7 thalas with 5 possibilities of thalas gives us 35 thalas. 

Within each thala, one must also take into consideration the _Gati_, which is the subdivision of each beat within the thala. The five different Gatis are the same as the 5 gatis.
